Read me for ECE 420 Lab4 Script Kit
Mar. 2024

=====
Overview:
    There are four groups of scripts in this kit
    
-----
    Data selection program and original data:
    web-Standford.txt	original data
    datatrim.c          source file to fetch a subset of the original data and pre-process it

-----
    Important functions:
    timer.h        macro definition for the time measurement
    Lab4IO.h       header for the Lab4IO.c, needs to be included if call the IOs directly from Lab4IO.c
    Lab4IO.c       source file for the IO functions, needs to be referred in the compiler line if the functions are called in the program

-----
    Template script:
    main_template.c  an incomplete serial implementation provided as a template (you may ignore this script if you want)

-----
    Verification program:
    serialtester  executable file for the testing program.
                  to use:
                      1. run "sha256sum serialtester" and check that the output checksum is "598471b927d0d03e1ea0623dfeaeeb560efa0bcc5e22dc8680867111df59b341"
                      2, run "chmod +x serialtester" to grant execution permission
                      3. run "./serialtester" to verify the results
                      note: 
                      - do not run the serialtester if the checksum does not match (re-download the file if necessary)
                      - the serialtester only works on the VM (it will probably not work on your local device)
                      - make sure that "data_input_link", "data_input_meta", and "data_output" are consistent with each other
