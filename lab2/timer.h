/*
Macro for time measuring.

To use this macro, you need to declare two double type variables 
to store the start time and the end time. The macro GET_TIME() will
return the time to the variable you put in. e.g., for your program, 
you need to declare two varibles first:
double start, end;
at where you want to record the starting time, put
GET_TIME(start);
at where you want to record the end time, put
GET_TIME(end);
Then the elapsed time would be
end-start
